# Lua UTF-8
[Lua 5.3][1] came with a nice UTF-8 support library internally boundled.
This is that same library packaged as a standalone library, which can be used by any version of Lua (5.1, 5.2 and LuaJIT).

## Installing `lutf8`
On Unix systems or using a Make-like interface simply run
```
sudo make
sudo make install
```
For more information on how to customize the building procedure, check both makefiles (at [root][2] and [src][3])

You can also grab a [rock][4]!
```
luarocks install lutf8
```
## Usage
```lua
local utf = require "utf8"
```
Check the [Lua Manual][5] for information
